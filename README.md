# MALLOC_FUNC
The malloc() function is a dynamic data memory allocation that can increase beyond the scope of the limit. It can increase beyond the set size if required.

1. declaring void variable A pointer is assigned to the memory in malloc, its data type is also fixed. The pointer points to a specified location, in the next line, it moves to the successive memory location.

2. store character A program was made that accepts character-type data in the malloc data structure.

3. using This program illustrates the usage of the malloc function. The pointer points to one location in the character-type memory, s, and then moves on to the successive location, value of which is stored in a.
